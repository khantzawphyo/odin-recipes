    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers

        </li>
        <li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
        </li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced

        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion

        </li>
        <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce

        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil

        </li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten
        </li>
        <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir
            until well
            mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over
            to form a
            triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface
            until ready to
            cook.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking
            together; steam
            for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
